# PatchMind

PatchMind is a modular Python-based framework that monitors a local Git repository for changes and suggests automated patches. It is designed for developers who want lightweight tooling to keep their codebase clean and up to date.

## Why PatchMind?

Keeping track of every small change in a project can be tedious. PatchMind exists to analyze repository updates, evaluate their significance, and propose patch suggestions automatically. This helps maintainers stay focused on what matters while benefiting from quick feedback about potential improvements.

## How It Works

1. **Monitor**: Watch a local Git repository for file additions, deletions, and modifications.
2. **Evaluate**: Determine the impact of these changes and identify areas that could use patches.
3. **Suggest**: Provide patch suggestions through a simple command-line interface.

```
[Repository] -> [PatchEngine] -> [Patch Suggestions]
```

## Running the CLI

PatchMind ships with a command-line interface. After installing the dependencies, run:

```bash
python -m cli.main
```

This will execute the `main()` function in `cli/main.py` and provide access to future commands.
